        <h1>Books I've Read So Far in 2025</h1>
<p>I have had a good time, reading mostly fiction so far. The best book I have read so far this year (and that will probably remain true for a while still) is <em>Hum</em> by Helen Phillips. She really captured... a lot about being a person in our times.</p>
<p>Other books I've read:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Identical</em> by Scott Turow: lots of twists. I interrupted my reading to tell my girlfriend about the twists six or seven times. I enjoyed it but I don't know if I would call it good, exactly?</li>
<li><em>Only One Survives</em> by Hannah Mary McKinnon: I found this on the front page of the library website but I'm pretty sure it's a BookTok kind of book. I had fun reading it, I read it in one sitting, but it was a popcorn book really.</li>
<li><em>Survival of the Richest</em> by Douglas Rushkoff: Good. Infuriating. Everyone reading this (future me, basically) is already familiar with the article this started off as.</li>
<li><em>Empire Games</em> by Charles Stross: This guy changed my life with <em>Glasshouse</em> and this book was so good I almost bought the sequel immediately when I saw I'd have to place a gold to get it through the library.</li>
<li>I also read a personal finance book. I am comfortable with investments and such but a refresher every now and then is good I guess.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am currently rereading <em>A Game of Thrones</em> but I have a feeling like I should be reading some nonfiction soon.</p>
