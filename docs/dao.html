        <h1>Dragon Age: Origins</h1>
<p>I have long told people this is my favourite game of all time. I love the leveling up system, I love Morrigan, I love Alistair, I love being a dwarf and having a low centre of gravity for fights, I love the lore, I love everything about it.</p>
<p>However, it has been quite a while since I was able to play it---unlike what happened with <em>Mass Effect</em>, there has been no updated/remastered/legendary edition of this game. And I wonder, how has this game held up? How fresh does the writing feel in a post BG3 world? How will the fighting feel, in a world where for all of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's faults the fighting system in that game was <em>amazing</em>?</p>
<p>We're going to find out.</p>
<h1>The DAO project</h1>
<p>The DAO project is my fancy name for just playing my favourite game for the first time in a decade. It took some planning and tinkering, but I have managed to get Dragon Age origins running on my Steam Deck. Despite reports by many of frequent crashes rendering the game unplayable, I have had no issue in my first 11 hours of gameplay. I am still saving <em>very</em> frequently to protect against this in case it were to happen to me.</p>
<h1>First impressions</h1>
<ul>
<li>oh my god look at how cardboardy and quaint the graphics are!!</li>
<li>hey I remember how to solve this puzzle, wow</li>
<li>the quality of voice acting in video games has truly gone up in the past 16 or so years</li>
<li>being Sereda Aeducan feels like seeing an old friend</li>
<li>damn I missed Orzammar</li>
<li>wow this king has no concept of boundaries eh?</li>
<li>aw shit the battle started already, I missed out on getting the mabari companion</li>
<li>Shale!!!!</li>
<li>having played all the DA games... I obviously remembered Morrigan being young and annoyed at life in this game, but I did not anticipate how what I thought was cool when I was 22 or whatever reads as highly annoying in my late 30s</li>
