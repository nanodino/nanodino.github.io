# Books I've Read So Far in 2025

I have had a good time, reading mostly fiction so far. The best book I have read so far this year (and that will probably remain true for a while still) is _Hum_ by Helen Phillips. She really captured... a lot about being a person in our times. 

Other books I've read:

1. _Identical_ by Scott Turow: lots of twists. I interrupted my reading to tell my girlfriend about the twists six or seven times. I enjoyed it but I don't know if I would call it good, exactly? 
2. _Only One Survives_ by Hannah Mary McKinnon: I found this on the front page of the library website but I'm pretty sure it's a BookTok kind of book. I had fun reading it, I read it in one sitting, but it was a popcorn book really.
3. _Survival of the Richest_ by Douglas Rushkoff: Good. Infuriating. Everyone reading this (future me, basically) is already familiar with the article this started off as. 
4. _Empire Games_ by Charles Stross: This guy changed my life with _Glasshouse_ and this book was so good I almost bought the sequel immediately when I saw I'd have to place a gold to get it through the library.
5. I also read a personal finance book. I am comfortable with investments and such but a refresher every now and then is good I guess.

I am currently rereading _A Game of Thrones_ but I have a feeling like I should be reading some nonfiction soon.
