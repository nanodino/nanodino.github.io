# on becoming a strange keyboard person

I have become a weird keyboard person. Not a person who is weird about keyboards (that I've been for a long time), but a person who uses a strange keyboard. Specifically, I am now a person who uses a split ortholinear keyboard with a Colemak layout. 

I consider it official now because, on a recent work trip, I used a regular QWERTY keyboard and it felt... bad. Not that I was slow (I have over three decades of muscle memory!), but that my wrists vaguely hurt and
my shoulders felt tight. I also felt like I had no space. And also, some keys just weren't where I expected them to be. It was not great!

In summary, I have ruined myself for normal people's keyboards. I hope I don't end up regretting that in the future. 

And anyway, I can write my email in one keystroke now. That will come in handy someday, I'm sure.
