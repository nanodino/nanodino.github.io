# Dragon Age: Origins 

I have long told people this is my favourite game of all time. I love the leveling up system, I love Morrigan, I love Alistair, I love being a dwarf and having a low centre of gravity for fights, I love the lore, I love everything about it.

However, it has been quite a while since I was able to play it---unlike what happened with _Mass Effect_, there has been no updated/remastered/legendary edition of this game. And I wonder, how has this game held up? How fresh does the writing feel in a post BG3 world? How will the fighting feel, in a world where for all of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's faults the fighting system in that game was _amazing_? 

We're going to find out.

# The DAO project

The DAO project is my fancy name for just playing my favourite game for the first time in a decade. It took some planning and tinkering, but I have managed to get Dragon Age origins running on my Steam Deck. Despite reports by many of frequent crashes rendering the game unplayable, I have had no issue in my first 11 hours of gameplay. I am still saving _very_ frequently to protect against this in case it were to happen to me.

# First impressions

- oh my god look at how cardboardy and quaint the graphics are!!
- hey I remember how to solve this puzzle, wow
- the quality of voice acting in video games has truly gone up in the past 16 or so years
- being Sereda Aeducan feels like seeing an old friend 
- damn I missed Orzammar 
- wow this king has no concept of boundaries eh?
- aw shit the battle started already, I missed out on getting the mabari companion
- Shale!!!!
- having played all the DA games... I obviously remembered Morrigan being young and annoyed at life in this game, but I did not anticipate how what I thought was cool when I was 22 or whatever reads as highly annoying in my late 30s
